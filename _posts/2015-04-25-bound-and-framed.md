#### What do we have:
A UITableView of country names. Each table cell contains a single UILabel for the name of the country.

<br />

#### The Problem:
When we scroll down, the countries tend to disappear.

<br />

#### Concepts:
CGGeometry, more specifically the difference between _frames_ and _bounds_.
