##Projective-C 

Projective-C is a collection of buggy Xcode projects for iOS interviews. Most of the problems are [FizzBuzz](http://imranontech.com/2007/01/24/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/) which are meant to be succinct, mostly revolving around a single concept. These are not overnight projects and shouldn’t be treated as such.

Like most ideas, this was born out of need rather than foresight. This collection started out as a way to find a happy medium between test assignments and theoretical questions. Finding short yet tricky problems, as it turned out, was a lot of fun: so I'm looking forward to adding more projects with time.
